## Design & Tools


## Things that could be improved
- Items should be cached.
- Should add unit tests.
- In a production application I would eject from create-react-app in order to be able to configure webpack.
- Panels should grow in height to accommodate items with many features.
- Panels should stack into a column when on small screens.
